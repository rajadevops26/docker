************************* steps to interact with docker in windows ********************************
step:1:  it communicate docker deamon in vm we need to give access as admin level
docker-machine.exe -D create --driver virtualbox kas4091docker
step:2: if you want to start the docke machine
docker-machine start kas4091docker
step:3: if you want to access the ip wee need to set envirnment
docker-machine env


******************docker-compose*****************
to start multipul container using single service we use docker-compse
docker-compose works on docker-compose.yaml or docker-compose.yml file
where the file locateed there we can execute the commands
step:1:
docker-compose --build
docker-compose up
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose down
docker-compse --force-recreate
